  <h1> Soccer Skills with Steven Gerrard </h1>

  <p> Welcome students and parents! My name is Steven Gerrard. I am the soccer skills professor here at School of Sporting Knowledge. If your child is in the soccer path, I will be teaching them all I know about the beautiful game.</p>


  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12">
<h2> About Me </h2>
  <p> I, myself, used to play professional soccer in the English Premier League and MLS. For the bulk of my career, I played for Liverpool Football Club. While I was there I won trophies including the Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup, and League Cup. I am now retired, and I hope to use my experience to enhance my student's ability in terms of the physical game itself. </p>
